# retinopathy_detection_by_image_classification

Help hospital detect Retinopathy with five stages via images, developed methods to be applied among areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct

Splitted 3,662 images into training and test-set, augmented imbalanced training dataset into 1000 images for each stage
by rotation, flipping, and sharpening

Tested and tuned multiple classification models, including Random Forrest, XGBoost and SVM

Trained CNN based on VGG-16 Architecture using TensorFlow package and got the best performing model
